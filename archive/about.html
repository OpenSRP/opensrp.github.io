		<h2>About</h2>

		<h4>About OpenSRP</h4>

		<p>Frontline Health Workers (FHWs), often the first and only contact for maternal and newborn health care in low- and middle-income countries, are burdened by archaic paper systems. Time spent on paperwork undermines the quality and coverage of essential services, increasing FHW frustration with disconnected bureaucratic systems. Additionally, governments struggle to supervise this large workforce; ensure data quality and timeliness of reporting; and guarantee appropriate and equitable care under low resource conditions.</p>

		<p>A combination of comprehensive client registration and robust data on reportable health and service events is critical for health systems to identify and address gaps in coverage, quality, and equity. Existing technology solutions are fragmented, unscalable, functionally limited, and are not interoperable with national-level information systems. Stand-alone technologies often do not adhere to global standards, integrate evidence-based guidelines or innovations in client and worker engagement. The Open Smart Register Platform aims to address each of these issues by creating a comprehensive smart register platform based on global standards of care and integrating with leading edge technologies.</p>
	<br>
		<h4>THRIVE Consortium</h4>

		<p>The Technologies for Health Registers, Information, and Vital Events (THRIVE) Consortium is a group composed of leading academic, research, donor, and IT institutions that is focused on adaptation, scaled deployment, and impact assessment of the OpenSRP platform and associated technology innovations in multiple countries. The Consortium’s guiding principles focus on user-centered design, research-informed adaptation, evidence-informed health content, and emergent mHealth best practices. OpenSRP deployments must meet the THRIVE Consortium standards of evidence-based practice and demonstrate quality and consistency of design (both user interface and IT architecture) across deployments. OpenSRP deployments focus on integrating with existing Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) and national-level health information systems that are aligned with OpenHIE standards, including the OpenMRS and DHIS2 platforms.</p>
	<br>
		<h4>OpenSRP Content</h4>

		<p>The Open Smart Register Platform (OpenSRP)is an android application running on health care providers’ tablets or smartphones which has a strong purposeful design and a comprehensive nature of the solution, encompassing reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health care (RMNCH) services. The platform brings the functions and design of existing paper register tools that health workers have used through their careers into the modern age. It also facilitates patient follow-up by incorporating the client data flow that is automated through the robust service schedules that transitions the clients from one state to another while relating the previous and current client data for future reference.</p>
		
		<p>In a single application, the app integrates previously discrete, proven innovations including: a client registry for enumeration and continuity of care; client's household details, eligible couples and mother and child registration; electronic forms with embedded logic and decision-support including checklists and algorithms for risk assessment; geo-fencing enabled by the location mapping per teams and team members, scheduling and service reminder tools; multimedia and IVR content for client counseling and reminders; and automated reporting into sub-district and national reporting systems.</p>

		<p>This mix of mobile technology, information system, and support materials is designed to facilitate and support various aspects of health workers’ work, and enable a flow of communication between community members, community health workers, health facilities, and the decision-makers who receive the  reports generated from the data collected.</p>

		<p>The use of a unifying registry enables consistency of approach across all health domain areas, ensuring that the health worker does not have to switch between applications with differing user interfaces and functionality across health areas. This consistency and simplicity of interface and design functionality facilitates ease of use, common approaches to training across health domain areas and uniformity of technical support.  Additionally, the Open Smart Register Platform (OpenSRP) is purposefully designed with end-users, to complement and bolster other robust and widely deployed information technology solutions, including OpenMRS for clinical records, and DHIS2 for reporting.</p>

		<h4>Governance</h4>

		<h5>Governance Model Diagram</h5>
		<p><img src="img/about-governance-model.jpg" width="100%"></p>

		<h5>Beneficiaries</h5>

		<p>The clients (i.e., men, women, and children) to whom the Frontline Health Workers (FHWs) provide routine primary health care.  The ultimate goal of OpenSRP is to improve the health of these beneficiaries.</p>

		<h5>FHWs</h5>
		
		<p>The direct users of the OpenSRP platform/application.  These OpenSRP users are government-trained / employed frontline health workers who are usually the first point of contact between a beneficiary and a country’s public health system.</p>

		<h5>FHW Supervisors</h5>
		<p>The direct managers/supervisors of the FHWs.  The FHW Supervisors usually do not provide direct care to beneficiaries; rather, they oversee a group of FHWs and are responsible for reviewing data from the FHWs and aggregating data to the next level in the government health care system (e.g., to district or province level).</p>

		<h5>Country Implementation Teams</h5>
		<p>Each THRIVE OpenSRP implementation (Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia) is run by that country’s implementation team, which is led by a country director or coordinator.  The country implementation team conducts the formative and field research for the THRIVE research study protocol and oversees the implementation of their country-adapted OpenSRP platform amongst the selected FHWs at their country research site.</p>

		<h5>Science Board</h5>
		<p>Composed of the PIs of each country implementation site, their in-country research leads, and WHO coordinators,  and the research leads in-country, the science board oversees the THRIVE research study implementation and ensures the research requirements for their site are communicated to the PM.  They ensure each implementation of OpenSRP has health content that is vetted against global health standards.</p>

		<h5>Product Manager</h5>
		<p>The PM(s) are responsible for balancing the needs of the different country implementations with the overall product roadmap and strategic direction of the OpenSRP platform product.  They communicate directly with the country implementation teams and the core dev team to ensure needs and expectations are communicated clearly.  The product manager is accountable to both the implementation teams and the enabling committee.</p>

		<h5>Core Dev</h5>
		<p>Composed of individual programmers from each country implementation site.  They work on core OpenSRP platform features and improvements as well as country-specific requirements.  One idea is to rotate developers between core OpenSRP dev work and their country’s specific implementation requirements.</p>

		<h5>Technology / Design Board</h5>
		<p>Composed of the tech leads from each country implementation site and senior architects; the role of the tech board is to make broad architecture decisions about the strategic direction and future development of OpenSRP.  They are the final say in terms of architecture decisions.  The Design Board oversees the various design implementations and ensures an overall quality design standard.</p>

		<h5>Enabling Committee</h5>
		<p>These committee members ensure that all other members in the THRIVE governance model have the means to carry out the product development and research priorities.  They are responsible for liaising with all of the THRIVE partners, potential new implementation teams, funders, and governments.  They are the final say if disagreements and/or competing interests cannot be resolved by the PM(s).  In short, the role of the Enabling Committee is to make sure each board / committee has the resources to successfully develop and implement OpenSRP at each THRIVE country site.</p>
