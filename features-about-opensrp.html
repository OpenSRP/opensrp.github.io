		<h2>About OpenSRP</h2>

		<br>
		<p>Frontline Health Workers (FHWs), often the first and only contact for health care services in low- and middle-income countries, are burdened by archaic paper systems. Time spent on paperwork undermines the quality and coverage of essential services, increasing FHW frustration with disconnected bureaucratic systems. Additionally, governments struggle to supervise this large workforce; ensure data quality and timeliness of reporting; and guarantee appropriate and equitable care under low resource conditions.</p>

		<p>A combination of comprehensive client registration and robust data on reportable health and service events is critical for health systems to identify and address gaps in coverage, quality, and equity. Existing technology solutions are fragmented, unscalable, functionally limited, and are not interoperable with national-level information systems. Stand-alone technologies often do not adhere to global standards, integrate evidence-based guidelines or innovations in client and worker engagement. The Open Smart Register Platform aims to address each of these issues by creating a comprehensive digital register platform based on global standards of care and integrating with leading edge technologies.</p>

		<p>OpenSRP can reduce the paper register and reporting burdens in health systems by providing frontline health workers and Ministries of Health with digital tools that improve:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="features-client-id-registration.html">Client identification &amp; registration</a> - Allowing health workers to better track their clients and providing governments with a reliable tool for collecting data at the source, resulting in a more accurate denominator. 
			</li>
			<li><a href="features-client-management.html">Client Management</a> - Promoting continuity of care across life stages and ensuring clients receive the complete package of health services with automated scheduling and showing reminders for follow-up visits and required services. 
			</li>
			<li><a href="features-workflow-support.html">Health Worker Workflow Support &amp; Reporting</a> - Supporting all cadres of frontline health workers in multiple geographies to provide quality care and submit quality data that is required for local and national health systems performance monitoring. 
			</li>
			<li><a href="features-interoperability.html">Interoperability</a> - Ability to integrate with existing, widely-used digital health information systems, such as DHIS2 as OpenMRS. 
			</li>
			<li><a href="features-project-monitoring.html">Project Monitoring &amp; Performance Management</a> - Enabling ministries of health and other governing institutions to make data-driven decisions, provide feedback on performance, and ensure quality control. 
			</li>
			<li><a href="features-supply-chain-management.html">Supply Chain Management</a> - Minimizing stock-outs and wastage by providing oversight of supplies available in the field. 
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>These features are combined in OpenSRP to create digital solutions for the following domains:</p>

		<ol>
			<li><b>Household (HH) module</b> - for enumeration of all households and their inhabitants in a health worker’s assigned catchment area</li>
			<li><b>Family Planning (FP) module</b> - for tracking family planning clients’ methods, refills, and side-effects</li>
			<li><b>Antenatal Care (ANC) module</b> - for registering all pregnant women and tracking their antenatal visits and services</li>
			<li><b>Postnatal Care (PNC) module</b> - for tracking a mother’s health after giving birth through postnatal care visits and services</li>
			<li><b>Vaccination Module</b> - for tracking vaccinations provided to mothers, children, and/or adolescents, i.e. an Electronic Immunization Register (EIR)</li>
			<li><b>Early Childhood Development (ECD) module</b> - for tracking a child’s cognitive and social development in the household and community</li>
			<li><b>Nutrition Module</b> - for tracking a child’s growth and nutritional status</li>
			<li><b>Stock Management module</b> - for tracking clinical supplies (only available for vaccines currently)</li>
			<li><b>Reporting module</b> - for automating real-time tallies and report aggregations to submit to the district </li>
			<li><b>(In progress) Presumptive, Positive, and In-treatment Tuberculosis (TB) modules</b> - for TB case detection and treatment management</li>
		</ol>
