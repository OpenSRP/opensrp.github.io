		<h2>Technologies &amp; Vendors Supporting the Open Smart Register Platform</h2>
<br>

		<h3>Technologies</h3>
		<p>The Open Smart Register Platform (OpenSRP) leverages several popular open source platforms while incorporating new open source technologies developed to make it easier to create interactive and intelligent mobile interfaces. The mobile client consists of an Android application with a Smart Registry UI optimized for tablets. Data is collected on the app with Enketo smart paper forms, which are built to resemble paper, but supports advanced skip/form logic including constraint checks. The app is built to allow the health care worker to register, update client details, including transition from different registers e.g. antenatal care to post-natal care register, and review clients when not online and then sync intelligently when connected.</p>

		<p>The Smart Registry backend, which provides ability to store basic patient records in a document-based database (couchDB), incorporates:</p>

		<p>The existing <b>MoTeCH</b> platform which provides libraries that makes areas such as writing health schedules and generating alerts and reminders and <b>RapidPro</b> workflows for communicating via SMS and IVR more efficient. The Ona platform is used to author and organize the forms used in the application, taking advantage of the robust organization and project management functionalities of the platform.</p>

		<p>OpenSRP integrates with <b>OpenMRS</b> for the primary health record store, storing the data in a format that is widely used and recognized in health systems around the world. OpenSRP also leverages on the OpenMRS robust reporting, user and team management and location mapping modules.</p>
