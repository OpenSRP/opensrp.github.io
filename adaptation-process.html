		<h2>Adaptation Process</h2>
		<br>
		<h4>Process Overview</h4>

		<p>OpenSRP has a modular design that allows it to be easily adapted to other country settings, topics and cadres of health workers so that it may facilitate accurate, real-time data collection and be utilized  for local- or national-level routine health information systems. The THRIVE Consortium has identified four country sites where government engagement and readiness would allow for client-focused systems to be adapted, refined, tested, and scaled as exemplars for other health systems.  These sites have developed, deployed, and refined a systematic adaptation process to review, with stakeholders, the national FHW information system and subsequently optimize, digitize, and institutionalize the use of OpenSRP. The adaptation processes include the use of the following methods:</p>
		<p>
			<ol>
				<li>Government engaged multi-stakeholder process; research adaptation site as complement to process</li>
				<li>Mapping of current cadre-specific work- and information-flows, reporting requirements</li>
				<li>Review of HIS eco-system; national priorities; system constraints</li>
				<li>Establishment of functional requirements needed for adaptation</li>
				<li>Collaborative data Optimization Process (reduce data burden); establishment of metrics and necessary aggregate indicators</li>
				<li>Technology Adaptation Process (form, register, interventions, schedules, permissions), and development of common concept dictionaries (ICD-10, CIEL) for OpenMRS and OpenHIE</li>
				<li>Integrations with other platforms, innovations and technologies in ecosystem (e.g., DHIS2, CRVS) to ensure mutual gain</li>
				<li>Costed plan for national institutionalization, support mechanisms</li>
		</p>

		<h4>THRIVE Multi-Site Study</h4>
		
		<p>Led by WHO HRP, the THRIVE Consortium members have launched a 5-year, multi-site research study that aims to adapt, implement at scale, and rigorously assess the impact of OpenSRP and related technologies on health system performance, Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, and Child Health (RMNCH) health outcomes and health information systems in multiple countries. The first phase of the study includes formative and field assessment research to adapt the OpenSRP platform to each of three local country settings, followed by a pilot evaluation among the relevant health worker cadres at each site to determine the factors necessary for high fidelity implementation, perceived value, worker performance and health system effect from the OpenSRP platform.</p>
 
		<p>This multi-site research study focuses on determining how mHealth strategies delivered through the OpenSRP platform can improve frontline workforce efficiencies, data quality, and timeliness of validated RMNCH health intervention delivery, while estimating the per-unit cost of various interventions and effect on specific health outcomes.</p>
